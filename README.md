## Personal Website (Jose Duran)

A lightweight, responsive personal site built with plain HTML, CSS, and JS. Includes sections for hero, about, skills, projects, and contact. Supports light/dark theme with persistence.

### Quick start
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Replace placeholder content with your own details:
	- Name, tagline, and links in `index.html`
	- Skills chips in `index.html`
	- Project cards (title, description, links) in `index.html`
	- Email and social URLs in `index.html`
3. Add your photo at `assets/profile.jpg` (create the `assets` folder if it doesn't exist).

### Customize
- Colors and spacing are defined in CSS variables in `styles.css`. You can adjust the palette by editing the `:root` and theme blocks.
- To change default theme, set `data-theme` on the `html` element in `index.html` to `light` or `dark`.

### Deploy (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a new repo and push this folder's contents.
2. In GitHub, open Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → `main` / root.
3. Your site will be available at the provided URL.
